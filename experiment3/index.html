				<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
				<p>With this experiment I wanted to create a generative art piece that could be manipulated via hand controls. The chaotic nature
					of the shapes, reflect the romantic yet brutalist nature of the poem lines. <b>Please press F to unfreeze and begin interaction</b>
				</p>
				<h2><b>Controls</b></h2>
				<p> Left-Hand/mouse cursor - the shapes will follow either. opening your hand will make the shapes grow more violent, closing vice versa. <br>
					M1 Click - reset the shape, center of shape will be mouse cursor location <br>
					Delete/Backspace - clear canvas, reset poem, shape stays the same <br>
					F - freezes/unfreezes the image. <br>
					S - saves the artwork as png <br>
					1 / 2 - Changes the drawing mode
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2><b>Technical</b></h2>
				<p>
				<b>Shape Generation</b><br>
					The circular shape is generated via a series of points, calculated with cos() and sin(). The
					startShape(), endShape(), and curveVertex() functions are all used to generate the smooth but wavy shapes.
					The series of points are distorted via the distance between the left hand's middle finger tip and its base, the greater the distance
					the more distortion. These points will always move towards the detected hand, but can be controled via the mouse if there isn't a
					hand detected.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Hand Manipulation</b><br>
					Using ml5.js, I set up an array to store the hands that are detected in the video. I then stored the x and y values for the middle
					finger tip, base of the middle finger, and made it exclusive to the left hand. I stored the dist() between the middle finger and the
					base, this is because I'm sure people aren't intuitively raising their middle finger due to the social implications of that, so they have
					to open their hand. When they open their hand the shape gets more violent and when they close it tames it.<br>
				<b>Text</b><br>
					I imported the font from Google fonts, and colored it white to give the effect that the user is revealing the poetry. I chose a
					font that best represents the atmosphere of the poems. The poems were mostly written by me with the exception of one. You can push
					the delete key which will clear the canvas and give you a different poem. A random poem is selected each time.
				</p>

				<h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>
				<p>I am so very pleased with how this project turned out, I set out to do what I wanted with this. I've learned a lot about
					hand manipulation, and I put a fair bit of myself in this project. I think it's a gorgeous glimpse into my creative process.
