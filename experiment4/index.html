				<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
				<p>With this experiment I aimed to create a collage style piece with your face features making up the components of this collage,
					this was originally supposed to be an homage to Coded Illustrations by Zach Iberman, but I really made it my own. 
				</p>
				<h2><b>Controls</b></h2>
				<p> Mouse(M1) - Click and drag the different features <br>
					Double Click - Delete graphic window containing the feature <br>
					S - saves the artwork as png <br>
					1 - toggles the sidebar <br>
					2 - toggles the after images <br>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2><b>Technical</b></h2>
				<p>
				<b>Feature Windows</b><br>
					Using ml5.js, and it's FaceMesh, I was able to create graphical windows around the face features I want by referencing the keypoints
					that correlate to different parts of the face. There is a class that contains a function to create these windows, the default function
					takes the x and y values that the keypoints provide and creates a graphical window using the minX, minY, maxX, and maxY. The origin
					is shifted to the center of the graphical window, to ensure that scaling is centered to the facial feature. <br>

				<b>Drag and Drop & Other Mouse Functionality</b><br>
					When the user clicks on the graphical window, the code first checks whether or not the mouse is on the window, then it redraws the
					window each time the draw() function is called, and continues to follow the mouse position. We use the same logic for deletion, 
					we detect whether or not we are hovering above a window, and then remove the window from our array of graphic windows. By not drawing
					the background we are able to create the after image effect.<br>
				<br>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>
				<p>My first time seeing the work of Zach Iberman, I was very inspired to make something similar, and I am very glad that I have achieved
					the technical ability to do so.
