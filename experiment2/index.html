				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment I aimed to create a somewhat audioreactive, line render with blob tracking.
					The original image was of graffiti that I saw when I was in Naples, and a photo of my
					mouth after a brutal mosh pit. The image is also being distorted.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used audio input to affect the speed of the line renderer, and the blob tracking.
					I then used Gausian noise to render the line's bizzare shape, and used the same
					noise to distort the image. I used the RGBA values from the Gausian noise to
					create those weird numbers at each of the line segments. They look like alien language
					because of the font I used. For the numbers within the blob render I used the dataset
					provided by the blob render node. The entire project was made in TouchDesigner.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					It was a bit difficult deciding exactly what I wanted for the background image.
					I wanted it to be unique and I wanted to make the project my own as much as I could.
					I take a lot of photos when I travel and stumbled upon that image of the angel, I was
					inspired by these rough collages I see on my Pinterest that featured related images
					crudely stacked upon one another. I spent a long while with the technical aspects of the
					project because I wanted the line segment to reflect what I thought a biblically accurate
					angel's halo would look like. I spend awhile deciding on what font I wanted for the line segment
					also on the colors. Bringing the video to p5.js was not too much of a problem, however, I did
					encounter issues with the resolution.
