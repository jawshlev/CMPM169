					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Saludos! I'm Josh Levano &#40;they/he&#41;, a fourth year at UCSC. I quite enjoy the blend of art and technology, fashion, and going to the gym.
					I want to explore the intersection of art and tech, to be inspired, and to create. Recent obsessions include clear case
					tech from the early 2000s (Walkmans, CRT TVs, etc), Japanese fashion label Julius_7, and mounting houseplants onto things.
					I would say I'm relatively proficient when it comes to coding in JS/C++/CSS/HTML, as I've taken quite a few coding classes
					during my time at UCSC but I know that I've still got a lot to learn.</p>
